multigrid Poisson solver
cpu.lua is the Lua table CPU version
cpu-raw.lua is raw pointer CPU version ... because this is what will be needed for a cpu/gpu multigrid solver.
gpu.lua is the GPU version, based on my "require 'cl'"
gpu-obj.lua is the gpu version based on my "require cl.obj'", which is aimed at being more concise than gpu.lua
